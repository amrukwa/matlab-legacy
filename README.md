# Spectre

## What is this?

Aim of this project is to provide a versatile tool for MALDI-MSI data sets
analysis.

This goal is realized by a web application, which will be easily accessible to
anyone soon. If you would like to host it yourself - here are the sources, so
you can build and run it.

## What can I do with this?

This project is in its very early stage. However, we are implementing our own
spectra modelling based on Gaussian Mixture Models, and Divisive IK-means
algorithm for unsupervised segmentation, which can be used for efficient dataset
compression as well as for knowledge discovery. Those algorithms have already
been published, so for any details, please check [references](#references).

Also, several classification and clusterization methods will be provided soon,
along with supporting statistics.

## How to use this?

Details will be added soon.

## How to contribute?

Please contact us by an [e-mail](mailto:Grzegorz.Mrukwa@polsl.pl). We will
answer you in details.

## Environment

Details will be added soon.
